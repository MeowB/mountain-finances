Creating a structured development roadmap is an excellent approach to systematically build your application. Below is a week-by-week plan, detailing daily objectives to guide you through the process. This plan assumes a 5-day workweek, allowing flexibility for review and unforeseen adjustments.

**Week 1: Project Initialization and Authentication System**

- **Day 1:**
 - Chose the tech stack (Django, PostgreSQL, React, TypeScript).
 - Setup the Django project and create the initial project structure.
 - Configure PostgreSQL and ensure database migrations work correctly.
- **Day 2:**
 - Apply the login page design (layout, input fields, buttons).
 - Set up the color scheme and typography for the application.
 - Start implementing the user authentication system and account management.
